# 40 - Linux Basics 3

*Written by Michael Zhang*

## Problem

Ok, so now you know how to list files and read files... this is starting to sound more like a file manager you are familiar with, right? So what's left now? Searching.

Luckily, there's also a command for that: `grep`. You know the drill, read up on the command, and then solve the problem in `/problems/grep`.

The flag is the filename of the file containing the string `yep!`. All other files will contain the string `nope!`.

## Hint

What character stands for "all files"?

## Solution

```bash
login as: user37142
user37142@shell.easyctf.com's password:

user37142@easyctf:~$ cd /problems/grep
user37142@easyctf:/problems/grep$
