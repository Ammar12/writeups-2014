# 35 - A Simple Cipher

*Written by Devin Deng*

## Problem

Cryptography is hiding messages in plain sight. Although they can be viewed, they are usually unreadable without the use of a special key. Messages can be encrypted and then sent to another person who then decrypts the ciphertext (encrypted message) using their special key into plaintext (readable text). Try your hand at this [Caesar cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher):

## Hint

Don't worry, it'll get harder. ;)

## Solution

In a caesar cipher all the letters are shifted by the same amount. Use [this tool](http://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/) to solve this cipher. This website has an algorithm that can guess the key, which turns out to be 20. The final text is:

CAESAR BECAME THE FIRST ROMAN GENERAL TO CROSS BOTH WHEN HE BUILT A BRIDGE ACROSS THE RHINE AND CONDUCTED THE FIRST INVASION OF BRITAIN.THESE ACHIEVEMENTS GRANTED HIM UNMATCHED MILITARY POWER AND THREATENED TO ECLIPSE THE STANDING OF POMPEY, WHO HAD REALIGNED HIMSELF WITH THE SENATE AFTER THE DEATH OF CRASSUS IN 53 BC. WITH THE GALLIC WARS CONCLUDED, THE SENATE ORDERED CAESAR TO STEP DOWN FROM HIS MILITARY COMMAND AND RETURN TO ROME. CAESAR REFUSED, AND MARKED HIS DEFIANCE IN 49 BC BY CROSSING THE RUBICON WITH A LEGION, LEAVING HIS PROVINCE AND ILLEGALLY ENTERING ROMAN TERRITORY UNDER ARMS. CIVIL WAR RESULTED, FROM WHICH HE EMERGED AS THE UNRIVALED LEADER OF ROME. THE FLAG IS CAESAR_IS_HOME.
