# 40 - QR

*Written by Emily Leng*

## Problem

Something appears to be wrong with this QR. Can you fix it?

<img src="code.png" width="120" height="120" />

## Hint

The QR looks like it's missing some pixels...

## Solution

The QR is missing some pixels at the top and the right sides. Luckily, reading an image through a camera is almost always extremely inaccurate, so most optical QR scanners are able to compensate.

Just scan the QR using Google Goggles.

## Flag
