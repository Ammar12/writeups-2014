# 45 - Python Basics 4 (TODO)

*Written by Emily Leng*

## Problem

`args` is an array of 5 variables than can be accessed with `args[0]`, `args[1]` etc. Write some python code in the IDE to concatenate `args[0]`, `args[1]`'s type (`string` or `integer`), `args[2]`'s length, `args[3]`'s square root as an integer (will be a perfect square), and `args[4]` in reverse.

Clarification: for `args[0]`, concatenate its value, not its type.

## Hint

I hope you're taking notes; this stuff will be on the harder problems :)
