# 30 - Python Basics 1

*Written by Emily Leng*

## Problem

Welcome to Python crash course! To get started, head over to the [Python Editor](http://easyctf.com/exec) and print the string `Hello, EasyCTF!` exactly like that to the console.

## Hint

Not sure how to print in Python? Look it up (maybe on our Learn page?)! It probably uses the `print` function.

## Solution

```python
print "Hello, EasyCTF!"
```
