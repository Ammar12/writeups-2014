*Written by Michael Zhang*

## Problem

A friend has created a code for you to guess because he has no life and spends all his time making this kind of stuff.

Anyways, here it is: [A000045.txt](http://www.easyctf.com/problem_data/A000045/A000045.txt)

## Hint

Ask Google what A000045 might mean.

## Solution

A quick Google search for A000045 would bring up the fibonacci numbers. Just use the fibonacci numbers as array indices for the characters in A000045.txt.

```python
fib = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17711,28657,46368,75025,121393,196418,317811,514229,832040,1346269,2178309,3524578,5702887,9227465,14930352,24157817,39088169];
f = open('A000045.txt', 'r')
stuff = f.read().strip()
result = ''
for x in fib:
	if x >= len(stuff):
		break
	result += stuff[x]
print result
```

The result printed is `pffibonacciiscoolandtheflagisrecursion`

## Flag

`recursion`
