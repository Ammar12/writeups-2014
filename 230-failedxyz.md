# 230 - failedxyz

## Problem

My name is Michael Zhang.

## Hint

This is a recon problem. Clues are scattered over the internet, and you have to piece them together to solve the problem. THIS IS INSANELY HARD. If you solve this problem, you are required to write a write-up and send it (using the email you signed your team up with) to failed.down@gmail.com.

## Solution

This problem had 4 parts. These 4 parts could be found by scouring all of my accounts and looking for flag-related clues. Obtaining my phone number and address didn't get you anywhere as far as solving the problem.

### Part 1

On my YouTube channel at http://youtube.com/user/failedxyz, one of the videos is called [**ice - L (Cytus)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUSQBqGZwH4). In the description of the video you'll find these lines:

```
Part One
If you're looking for something, "failed_up_".
```

Another way to reach this video is from my MuseScore profile, which is linked on multiple sites across the internet. [One of my transcriptions](http://musescore.com/user/133763/scores/213861) links to the above video.

### Part 2

My [personal site](http://failedxyz.github.io) would be a good place to look for clues. In this case, the source code was publicly available on GitHub, so instead, the clue was hidden inside the profile image on the top right.
