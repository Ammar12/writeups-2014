# 35 - Linux Basics 2

*Written by Michael Zhang*

## Problem

Now that you're somewhat familiar with how the Linux shell works, we'll move on to another command that is useful: [cat](http://linux.die.net/man/1/cat).

To solve this problem, log into the shell server, and try to find out what's inside `/problems/cat/flag.txt`!

## Hint

There are multiple ways to solve this problem; kudos to you if you find them all!

## Solution

```bash
login as: user37142
user37142@shell.easyctf.com's password:

user37142@easyctf:~$ cat /problems/cat/flag.txt
